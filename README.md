# 🖥️ Secure Linux Endpoint Lab

## 📌 Overview
The **Secure Linux Endpoint Lab** is a hands-on project that demonstrates how to **harden and monitor a Linux system** using **open-source tools**.  
It highlights skills in **system administration** and **SOC engineering** by focusing on endpoint protection, log analysis, and attack detection.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Configure and harden a Linux VM (Ubuntu/Debian)  
- Implement **endpoint security tools** (Auditd, Fail2Ban, ClamAV, AIDE, Suricata, Wazuh agent)  
- Simulate attacks (brute force, malware, unauthorized file changes)  
- Detect, log, and respond to incidents  

---

## 🏗️ Lab Setup
- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox / VMware / Proxmox  
- **OS**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (recommended)  
- **Network**: NAT or Bridged for connectivity  
- **Tools Installed**:  
  - 🔐 **Fail2Ban** → SSH brute force protection  
  - 🔑 **Auditd** → Activity logging  
  - 🛡️ **ClamAV** → Malware detection  
  - 📂 **AIDE** → File integrity monitoring  
  - 🌐 **Suricata** → Network intrusion detection  
  - 📊 **Wazuh Agent** → Log collection & SOC monitoring

## 🔐 Security Hardening Steps

**1. System Hardening**

- Disable root login over SSH
- Enforce SSH key authentication + Fail2Ban
- Configure firewall (UFW/iptables)
- Apply automatic updates & patches
- Remove unnecessary services and packages

**2. User & Access Management**

- Create admin user with sudo privileges
- Enforce password policies (PAM)
- Implement least privilege access (RBAC)

**3. Endpoint Protection Tools**

- Audit & Monitoring:
- Auditd (system activity logging)
- Syslog centralized logging
- Malware & Threat Detection:
    - ClamAV (antivirus)
    - Rkhunter (rootkit detection)
- Intrusion Detection:
    - Wazuh agent (or OSSEC agent) installed on VM

**4. File & System Integrity**

- AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) for file integrity monitoring
- Tripwire (optional alternative)

**5. Network Security**

- IDS with Suricata (local rules for endpoint traffic monitoring)
- Port scan detection (psad)

## 1. System Hardening

System hardening is the process of securing a Linux endpoint by reducing its attack surface, enforcing strong access controls, and applying security best practices.  
This includes disabling risky defaults, configuring firewalls, enforcing secure authentication, removing unnecessary services, and keeping the system up to date with patches.  

The goal is to make the system more resilient against unauthorized access, malware, and potential breaches while ensuring proper monitoring and accountability.

### 1.1 Disable Root Login over SSH

Direct root login over SSH is a common attack vector. Disabling it improves security by enforcing the principle of least privilege and making unauthorized access harder.

**1.1.1 Create a non-root admin user**

```bash
sudo adduser adminuser
sudo usermod -aG sudo adminuser
```

**1.1.2 Edit SSH configuration**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set the following:

```nginx
PermitRootLogin no
```

**1.1.3 Restart SSH service**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### 1.2 Enforce SSH Key Authentication + Fail2Ban

SSH key-based authentication is a secure alternative to passwords. Combined with Fail2Ban, it protects the server against brute-force attacks.

**1.2.1 Generate SSH Key Pair (on local machine)**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Accept default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

**1.2.2 Copy Public Key to Server**

```bash
ssh-copy-id adminuser@<VM_IP>
```
- Replaces `<VM_IP>` with your server’s IP.
- This appends your public key to `/home/adminuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
